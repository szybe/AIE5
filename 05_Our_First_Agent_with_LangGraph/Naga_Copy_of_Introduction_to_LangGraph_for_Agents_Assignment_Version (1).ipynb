        "LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Cycles?\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, we can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application agent-forward while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

              "'RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to improve the quality and relevance of generated text. The main idea behind RAG is to enhance the generative capabilities of models like GPT-3 by incorporating external information retrieved from a large corpus of documents or a database.\\n\\nIn a typical RAG setup, when a query is received, the system first retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a pre-existing dataset. These retrieved documents are then used to condition the generative model, which produces a response that is informed by the retrieved information. This approach helps in generating more accurate and contextually relevant responses, especially for queries that require specific or up-to-date information.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in applications like question answering, where the system needs to provide precise answers based on a large and potentially dynamic set of data.'"

            "**Definition:**\n",
            "Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining input prompts to guide generative AI models, such as large language models (LLMs), to deliver useful, accurate, and relevant responses. It involves crafting effective prompts that enable AI models to generate responses based on given inputs, particularly in text-based tasks like Natural Language Processing (NLP). This practice is crucial for optimizing the outputs of AI tools, allowing users to achieve better results without needing to train models from scratch. Techniques in prompt engineering include few-shot learning, chain-of-thought reasoning, and iterative refinement.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Emergence:**\n",
            "Prompt engineering has become a significant skill in the age of artificial intelligence, especially with the rise of AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. While the concept of designing effective prompts has deep roots in human communication, its prominence as a discipline has grown alongside advancements in AI technology. The practice has evolved with the development of techniques and best practices for designing effective input prompts, becoming essential for various industries. The exact timeline of when prompt engineering became popular is not clearly defined, but it has gained significant attention with the recent AI revolution and the increasing capabilities of AI models.\n",

            "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technology that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to enhance the quality and relevance of generated content. It was introduced by researchers from Facebook AI (now Meta AI) in 2020. The concept was presented in their paper titled \"Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks,\" which highlighted RAG as a generative AI architecture that augments Large Language Models (LLMs) with fresh, trusted data retrieved from authoritative internal knowledge bases and enterprise systems to generate more informed and reliable responses.\n",
            "\n",
            "RAG has since evolved, with various studies and papers exploring its potential to improve the quality of LLM-generated responses by grounding the model on external sources of knowledge. It is particularly useful in scenarios where specialized data, such as medical, legal, or technical information, is required, which isn't well-represented in the public datasets used to train LLMs. The technology has been further developed to include modular frameworks and advanced retrieval processes to enhance its capabilities in knowledge-intensive tasks.\n",

            "Fine-tuning is a process in machine learning where a pre-trained model is further trained on a smaller, task-specific dataset. This allows the model to adapt to specific tasks or domains while leveraging the general knowledge it has already acquired during its initial training on a larger dataset. Fine-tuning is particularly useful because it can significantly improve the performance of models on specific tasks without requiring the extensive computational resources needed to train a model from scratch.\n",
            "\n",
            "Fine-tuning became prominent with the rise of transfer learning techniques, especially in the context of deep learning. It gained significant attention with the development of models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), which demonstrated the effectiveness of pre-training on large datasets followed by fine-tuning on specific tasks.\n",
            "\n",
            "The concept of fine-tuning has been around for a while, but it became a major focus in the machine learning community around the mid-2010s, particularly with the success of deep learning models in natural language processing and computer vision tasks.\n",

These agents have evolved from earlier AI systems like symbolic AI agents and rule-based systems such as ELIZA (1966). LLM-based agents leverage the generality and few-shot learning capabilities of large language models, allowing them to outperform traditional agents that often require task-specific design and engineering.\n",
