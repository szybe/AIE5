        "\n",
        "In LangChain, a Runnable is like a LEGO brick in your AI application - it's a standardized component that can be easily connected with other components. The real power of Runnables comes from their ability to be combined in flexible ways using LCEL (LangChain Expression Language).\n",

        "Every Runnable in LangChain follows the same pattern:\n",
        "- Takes an input\n",
        "- Performs some operation\n",
        "- Returns an output\n",

        "#### Why Cycles?\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!\n",

        "\n",
        "> coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications\n",
        "\n",
        "So what does that \"stateful\" mean?\n",
        "\n",
        "To put it simply - we want to have some kind of object which we can pass around our application that holds information about what the current situation (state) is. Since our system will be constructed of many parts moving in a coordinated fashion - we want to be able to ensure we have some commonly understood idea of that state.\n",
        "\n",
        "LangGraph leverages a `StatefulGraph` which uses an `AgentState` object to pass information between the various nodes of the graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are more options than what we'll see below - but this `AgentState` object is one that is stored in a `TypedDict` with the key `messages` and the value is a `Sequence` of `BaseMessages` that will be appended to whenever the state changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, in our example here, we're focusing on a simpler `State` object:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class State(TypedDict):\n",
        "    question: str\n",
        "    context: List[Document]\n",
        "    response: str\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's think about a simple example to help understand exactly what this means (we'll simplify a great deal to try and clearly communicate what state is doing):\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **We initialize our state object**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [],\n",
        "       \"response\": \"\"\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Our user submits a query to our application.**  \n",
        "   We store the user's question in `state[\"question\"]`. Now we have:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"How tall is the Eiffel Tower?\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [],\n",
        "       \"response\": \"\"\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **We pass our state object to an Agent node** which is able to read the current state. It will use the value of `state[\"question\"]` as input and might retrieve some context documents related to the question. It then generates a response which it stores in `state[\"response\"]`. For example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"How tall is the Eiffel Tower?\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [Document(page_content=\"...some data...\")],\n",
        "       \"response\": \"The Eiffel Tower is about 324 meters tall...\"\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "That's it! The important part is that we have a consistent object (`State`) that's passed around, holding the crucial information as we go from one node to the next. This ensures our application has a single source of truth about what has happened so far and what is happening now.\n",
